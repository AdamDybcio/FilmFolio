Leveraging the power of the TMDB API, the app allows users to discover new releases, search for their favorite films, and bookmark movies locally without requiring account creation. The application is built using the BLoC pattern for state management and CLEAN architecture to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.

Key features include:
*   **Movie Discovery:** Browse popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies.
*   **Search Functionality:** Quickly find movies by title.
*   **Local Bookmarking:** Save your favorite movies locally for easy access.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Well-structured codebase for easy understanding and contribution.
*   **BLoC Pattern:** Robust state management for a smooth user experience.

The application is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to quickly find the movies they're looking for. While multi-language support is not fully implemented, the groundwork has been laid, and contributions are welcome to complete this feature.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get FilmFolio up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the FilmFolio repository to your local machine using Git:


flutter pub get
> **Important:** Before running the app, you need to set up your TMDB API key. You can obtain an API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Once you have the key, open the app, go to the settings page, and enter your TMDB API key. Without the API key, the app will not be able to load any movie data.

### 2. Run the App

Run the FilmFolio application on your preferred device or emulator:

*   **API Key Issues:** Ensure you have correctly entered your TMDB API key in the settings page. Double-check for any typos.
*   **Dependency Conflicts:** If you encounter any dependency conflicts, try running `flutter pub upgrade` to update the packages to their latest compatible versions.
*   **Build Errors:** If you face any build errors, try cleaning the project using `flutter clean` and then running `flutter pub get` again.
